# MSC532_Assignment5

This Python script demonstrates both **Deterministic Quicksort** and **Randomized Quicksort** algorithms. It benchmarks their performance on various datasets by measuring sorting correctness, execution time, and peak memory usage.

---

## ðŸš€ Features

- Implements both **Deterministic** and **Randomized** versions of the Quicksort algorithm.
- Benchmarks the sorting performance on multiple datasets:
  - Sorted dataset
  - Reverse-sorted dataset
  - Random dataset
  - Dataset with repeated elements
- Measures:
  - Sorting correctness
  - Execution time
  - Peak memory usage using `tracemalloc`

## ðŸ’» How to Run

Ensure you have Python  installed. Then run file using:

```bash
python run QuickSort.py 
```
